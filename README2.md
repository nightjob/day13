<!-- User should be able to input their address into a search box in HTML and click a button to display their NFTs -->

<!-- 1. HTML input element of type text on the page -->

<!-- 2. HTML button element to click to fetch the ERC20s/NFTs -->

<!-- 3. HTML div element to put the results

4. HTML header elements, like "All ERC20 Tokens" and "All NFTs" -->

<!-- 5. javascript code that places an event listener on the button, and when clicked, gets the `.value` of the HTML input element with the user's address in it, so we can use the address!
  and then, for each ERC20s and NFTs:

6. a loop over the axios response data to iterate over the actual NFT's, -->
<!-- 
7. create some HTML elements IN javascript and insert them into the page in the relevant section. if NFTs, like an image element with the image of the NFT, and a header element with the name of the NFT, a span for the description, maybe the Opensea floor price? if ERC20s, the symbol and the amount?

8. and finally some CSS to style it! -->
